Q/What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A/it will make .git file that stores versions-history plus marking the current directory as repository,
I do need it so that I could return to older versions of my project and get the benifits of version-control. 

Q/How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A/changes to files in the staging area will be saved,
  while not all changes to files in the working directory or the repository will be saved,
  this give us the ability to decide what changes to record and what not to.
