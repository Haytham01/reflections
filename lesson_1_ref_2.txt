Q/What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit,
 like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A/
 pros:
 I could decide when and what I want to commit so I could choose the best commits
 cons:
 it is slow to do commits manually

Q/Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
 while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A/Because git is made specially for coding, thus we code usually when working on some project
 which contains many related files which are required for the project to work.vv
